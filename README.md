# MS-Valheim
This repository serves the purpose of sharing the world files of Valheim with each other, so that we can play without having to rely on someone hosting the server.
Follow the steps below to make sure, that everything works out.

If you have any questions, contact MeistaSoda#5695 or head to his [server](https://discord.gg/gGdvjUm3QJ) on Discord.

## SERVER FILES SHARING

### Step 1 - BACKUP
Make sure to create a backup of the world file before overwriting the file in your folder.
It is no problem to create a folder within the world saves or just outside that folder, to save a backup of all world files.

You should be able to find the server files in `C:\Users\[YOUR USER]\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds_local`
*Hint: open the __AppData__ folder with __%appdata%__ in the command prompt aka cmd.*

### Step 2 - COPY FILES
Copy all files from the folder that is named after the world you want to play in. Simply paste them in the **worlds_local** folder.

### Step 3 - PLAY & ENJOY
You should be able to find the local world in your game now. Make sure that it remains a local save file ingame as well, to avoid issues.
Make sure you inform your fellow Vikings whenever you start playing from those files and when you are done, so that you don't end up playing at the same time without sharing the progress. In that case you would have to sacrifice one of the two progresses in order to save the file.

### Step 4 - SAVE PROGRESS
After playing on the world, you should shut down the game and head to the folder that holds the saved world files. Copy them into the repository and commit the changes to github.
