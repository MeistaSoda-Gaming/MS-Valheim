# MS-Valheim
This repository serves the purpose of sharing the world files of Valheim with each other, so that we can play without having to rely on someone hosting the server.
Follow the steps below to make sure, that everything works out.

## Step 1 - BACKUP
Make sure to create a backup of the world file before overwriting the file in your folder.
You should be able to find the server files in `C:\Users\[YOUR USER]\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds_local`
